## Installation
To play this game you need to have Java installed, preferably Java 25. Afterwards you can clone the repository and run the Main.java file in your IDE.

## Roadmap
For future releases I would love to package the software and deliver it as a desktop application.

## Contributing
The whole Project is Documented and if you want to take it and use it as a template for your own project your welcome to that.
A mention would be nice :)

## License
This is a project made for a Module at the FHNW in Switzerland, so you can use the project for yourself but not to make money with it.

## Project status
This project has reached its end is being completed for evaluation by the coaches, after the 16th of February 2026 the project will be mostly neglected but used as an inspiration.
